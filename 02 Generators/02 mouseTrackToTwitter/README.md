###mouseTrackToTwitter
===================

this sketch keeps tracks of the global mouse x&y coordinates and writes them to a off-screen buffer.

+ you need to have your mouse moving for a while before it tracks the coordinates (standard is 60 seconds)
+ after 5 minutes of doing nothing, the sketch will generate a final image, slaps some typo on it and sends it to twitter

---

todo:

- **make it more beautiful!**
- better configuration file with more customization features
